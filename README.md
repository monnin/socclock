**SOC Clock**

This is a small digital clock that displays time in both local time and UTC time on two (or one) AdaFruit Matrix Portals, such as https://www.adafruit.com/product/4745

The clock was designed to support a Security Operations Center classroom (for in a Cybersecurity program) (hence it's name).

The clock has a web backend and can switch into countdown mode where the UTC clock is replaced with a countdown (e.g. if running a SOC scenario).
